# BestKabu Browser Extension
A Simple Browser extension that makes Digikabu.de better. This is a Fork of [@ouihq](https://github.com/ouihq/betterKabu)

# Usage

### Chromium: [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bestkabu/okajcjigbfoadcmmhckdpbopohdkhcpg)
### Firefox*: Use the .xpi file in the latest -fire release
**Note:** If you find a relayable way to install the Extension on Firefox on andorid, please let me know. It already should work fine in debugger mode.

**Hint:** On some browsers the Extension shows the link to digikabu.de even if you're on the website. Please check your Privacy settings and Extension permissions.

## Lesson highlighting
**Note:** Please submit (create an github issue) your school lesson abbreviations to set presets for the color.

## Login by Extension

5. Click the "Save Login" button.

## Colorpicker
To change the color of the highlighting: Open the Extension on the digikabu.de website and enter a HEX code in the input field. If you don't know them from memory, click on the link and copy the HEX code from there. A HEX code is always a "#" and 6 digits, that can be "0,1,2,...9, A, B, C, D, E, F".

## Current features:
- Dark mode toggle
- Login by Extension to make login faster
